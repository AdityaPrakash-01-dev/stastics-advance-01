        "### Theoretical Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is a random variable in probability theory?**\n",
        "   - A random variable is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. It can take on different values based on the outcome of a random event.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "   - There are two main types of random variables: discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables take on a countable number of distinct values, while continuous random variables take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n",
        "   - Discrete distributions describe the probabilities of discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of distinct values. Continuous distributions describe the probabilities of continuous random variables, which take on an infinite number of possible values within a range.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "   - A probability distribution function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value. For discrete variables, it is called a probability mass function (PMF), and for continuous variables, it is called a probability density function (PDF).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "   - The cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. The PDF (or PMF) gives the probability of the random variable taking on a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n",
        "   - A discrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution where a finite number of values are equally likely to occur. Each value has the same probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n",
        "   - The Bernoulli distribution models a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success (1) with probability \\( p \\) and failure (0) with probability \\( 1 - p \\). It is characterized by a single parameter \\( p \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**\n",
        "   - The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is characterized by two parameters: the number of trials \\( n \\) and the probability of success \\( p \\) in each trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n",
        "   - The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is characterized by a single parameter \\( \\lambda \\), which is the average rate of occurrence. It is often used in fields like telecommunications, astronomy, and biology.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n",
        "    - A continuous uniform distribution is a probability distribution where all intervals of the same length have equal probability. It is characterized by two parameters: the minimum value \\( a \\) and the maximum value \\( b \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?**\n",
        "    - The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean, with a bell-shaped curve. It is characterized by two parameters: the mean \\( \\mu \\) and the standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**\n",
        "    - The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important because it allows for the standardization of normal random variables, making it easier to calculate probabilities and compare different distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "    - The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. It is critical because it allows for the use of normal distribution-based methods in statistical inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",
        "    - The Central Limit Theorem explains why many statistical methods assume normality, as the distribution of sample means will tend to be normal even if the underlying population distribution is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "    - Z statistics are used in hypothesis testing to determine how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. They are used to calculate p-values and make decisions about the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n",
        "    - A Z-score is calculated as \\( Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\), where \\( X \\) is the data point, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation. It represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?**\n",
        "    - A point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter (e.g., sample mean). An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the parameter is expected to lie (e.g., confidence interval).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n",
        "    - Confidence intervals provide a range of values that are likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. They give an idea of the precision and reliability of the estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
        "    - A Z-score is used to calculate the margin of error in a confidence interval. The confidence interval is constructed around the sample mean using the Z-score and the standard error.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n",
        "    - Z-scores standardize different distributions, allowing for comparison across different scales and units. They transform data into a common scale based on standard deviations from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?**\n",
        "    - The assumptions include: the sample size should be sufficiently large (usually \\( n \\geq 30 \\)), the samples should be independent, and the population distribution should have a finite variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**\n",
        "    - The expected value is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. It is calculated as the weighted average of all possible values, weighted by their probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?**\n",
        "    - A probability distribution describes the likelihood of different outcomes of a random variable. The expected value is a summary measure of the central tendency of the distribution, representing the average outcome over many trials.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Questions:\n",
